 abstract = {We present a numerical strategy to design fiber based dual pulse light sources exhibiting two predefined spectral peaks in the anomalous group velocity dispersion regime. The frequency conversion is based on the soliton fission and soliton self-frequency shift occurring during supercontinuum generation. The optimization process is carried out by a genetic algorithm that provides the optimum input pulse parameters: wavelength, temporal width and peak power. This algorithm is implemented in a Grid platform in order to take advantage of distributed computing. These results are useful for optical coherence tomography applications where bell-shaped pulses located in the second near-infrared window are needed.},

@article{Liu.2017,
 abstract = {We demonstrate an energy scalable approach to implement ultrafast fiber laser sources suitable for deep tissue multi-photon microscopy imaging. Enabled by fiber-optic nonlinearities (dominated by self-phase modulation), these unique ultrafast sources produce nearly transform-limited pulses of 50-90 fs in duration with the center wavelength tunable in the wavelength range of 1030-1215 nm. The resulting pulse energy can be scaled up to 20 nJ by optimizing fiber dispersion, shortening fiber length, and using large-mode-area fibers. We applied such an energetic source to a proof-of-principle study of ex vivo human skin based on harmonics (i.e., second-harmonic generation and third-harmonic generation) imaging. This new type of fiber-format energetic ultrafast source provides a robust solution for multiphoton microscopy applications.},
