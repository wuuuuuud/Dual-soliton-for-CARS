  abstract = {We study experimentally the polarization of the radiation resulting from the pulse break-up process in a SMF-28 twisted fiber. The fiber twist causes circular birefringence and also mitigates the linear birefringence. The twisted fiber may be considered for nonlinear effect as fiber without linear birefringence, which allows the investigation of polarization properties which cannot be studied in common fibers because of the random residual birefringence. We found that the polarization of the formed solitons is more stable when the input pump polarization has elliptical polarization with big angle of ellipticity. At input polarization close to linear we observed that the polarization ellipticity angle tends to be higher than the polarization ellipticity angle of the input pump. The fluctuation of the polarization grows when the input polarization approaches to the linear.},

  abstract = {Raman scattering provides an intrinsic fingerprint of chemical composition. Spontaneous Raman spectroscopy has been used for many decades to interrogate biological materials and systems. In spite of its valuable information content, Raman imaging is rarely used compared with modalities such as fluorescence microscopy because of its relatively slow signal acquisition. Coherent Raman imaging technologies have evolved over the past fifteen years to now capture rich chemical information with improved acquisition speeds. As a result, coherent Raman imaging methods are now poised to begin emerging as widely used tools for obtaining functional information in a label-free manner from biological systems. We briefly review the development and application of these methods.},

  abstract = {Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microspectroscopy has demonstrated significant potential for biological and materials imaging. To date, however, the primary mechanism of disseminating CARS spectroscopic information is through pseudocolor imagery, which explicitly neglects a vast majority of the hyperspectral data. Furthermore, current paradigms in CARS spectral processing do not lend themselves to quantitative sample-to-sample comparability. The primary limitation stems from the need to accurately measure the so-called nonresonant background (NRB) that is used to extract the chemically sensitive Raman information from the raw spectra. Measurement of the NRB on a pixel-by-pixel basis is a nontrivial task; thus, surrogate NRB from glass or water is typically utilized, resulting in error between the actual and estimated amplitude and phase. In this paper, we present a new methodology for extracting the Raman spectral features that significantly suppresses these errors through phase detrending and scaling. Classic methods of error correction, such as baseline detrending, are demonstrated to be inaccurate and to simply mask the underlying errors. The theoretical justification is presented by re-developing the theory of phase retrieval via the Kramers–Kronig relation, and we demonstrate that these results are also applicable to maximum entropy method-based phase retrieval. This new error-correction approach is experimentally applied to glycerol spectra and tissue images, demonstrating marked consistency between spectra obtained using different NRB estimates and between spectra obtained on different instruments. Additionally, in order to facilitate implementation of these approaches, we have made many of the tools described herein available free for download. Published 2015.

  abstract = {Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) is a powerful nonlinear spectroscopy technique that is rapidly gaining recognition of different molecules. Unfortunately, molecular concentration information is generally not immediately accessible from the raw CARS signal due to the nonresonant background. In addition, mainstream biomedical applications of CARS are currently hampered by a complex and bulky excitation setup. Here, we establish a dual-soliton Stokes based CARS spectroscopy scheme capable of quantifying the sample molecular, using a single fiber laser. This dual-soliton CARS scheme takes advantage of a differential configuration to achieve efficient suppression of nonresonant background and therefore allows extraction of quantitative composition information. Besides, our all-fiber based excitation source can probe the most fingerprint region (1100-1800 cm(-1)) with a spectral resolution of 15 cm(-1) under the spectral focusing mechanism, where is considerably more information contained throughout an entire spectrum than at just a single frequency within that spectrum. Systematic studies of the scope of application and several fundamental aspects are discussed. Quantitative capability is further experimentally demonstrated through the determination of oleic acid concentration based on the linear dependence of signal on different Raman vibration bands.

  abstract = {Raman spectroscopy has emerged as a promising tool for its noninvasive and nondestructive characterization of local chemical structures. However, spectrally overlapping components prevent the specific identification of hyperfine molecular information of different substances, because of limitations in the spectral resolving power. The challenge is to find a way of preserving scattered photons and retrieving hidden/buried Raman signatures to take full advantage of its chemical specificity. Here, we demonstrate a multichannel acquisition framework based on shift-excitation and slit-modulation, followed by mathematical post-processing, which enables a significant improvement in the spectral specificity of Raman characterization. The present technique, termed shift-excitation blind super-resolution Raman spectroscopy (SEBSR), uses multiple degraded spectra to beat the dispersion-loss trade-off and facilitate high-resolution applications. It overcomes a fundamental problem that has previously plagued high-resolution Raman spectroscopy: fine spectral resolution requires large dispersion, which is accompanied by extreme optical loss. Applicability is demonstrated by the perfect recovery of fine structure of the C-Cl bending mode as well as the clear discrimination of different polymorphs of mannitol. Due to its enhanced discrimination capability, this method offers a feasible route at encouraging a broader range of applications in analytical chemistry, materials and biomedicine.},

However, the complicating influence of the nonresonant response on the CARS signal severely limits its sensitivity and specificity and especially limits the extent to which CARS microscopy has been used as a fully quantitative imaging technique. On the basis of spectral focusing mechanism, we establish a dual-soliton Stokes based CARS microspectroscopy and microscopy scheme capable of quantifying the spatial information of densities and chemical composition within inhomogeneous samples, using a single fiber laser. Dual-soliton Stokes scheme not only removes the nonresonant background but also allows robust acquisition of multiple characteristic vibrational frequencies. This all-fiber based laser source can cover the entire fingerprint (800-2200 cm(-1)) region with a spectral resolution of 15 cm(-1). We demonstrate that quantitative degree determination of lipid-chain unsaturation in the fatty acids mixture can be achieved by the characterization of C = C stretching and CH2 deformation vibrations. For microscopy purposes, we show that the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of lipid droplets can be further quantitatively visualized using this quantified degree of lipid unsaturation in the acyl chain for contrast in the hyperspectral CARS images. The combination of compact excitation source and background-free capability to facilitate extraction of quantitative composition information with multiplex spectral peaks will enable wider applications of quantitative chemical imaging in studying biological and material systems.},

The strong birefringence of a polarization-maintaining photonic crystal fiber has the potential to simultaneously generate two solitons along different eigenpolarization axes, allowing for an extra degree of freedom in tuning the properties of the supercontinuum. With well-separated spectral regions of this dual-soliton, the CARS spectral coverage can be greatly extended. Taking advantage of the dispersion characteristic of the two orthogonal polarized modes and applying identical linear frequency chirp on both soliton Stokes pulses further allows that spectral CARS information can be encoded and acquired in time. The chirped pump pulse, in conjunction with dual-soliton Stokes pulses, can potentially yield gapless coverage of Raman transitions from 800 to 1800 cm(-1) with a spectral resolution of 15 cm(-1). Broadband spectral coverage capability is theoretically verified with simulations and then experimentally demonstrated by CARS spectroscopy with varied polymer materials. We also demonstrate hyperspectral Raman microscopy with molecular contrast of lipid droplets. An all-fiber-based broadband excitation source may greatly simplify CARS implementation and extend the qualitative and even quantitative chemical analysis of CARS microspectroscopy.},

Efforts are underway to transform this subjective art to an objective and quantitative science. Coherent Raman imaging (CRI), a label-free imaging modality with sub-cellular spatial resolution and molecule-specific contrast possesses characteristics which could support the qualitative-to-quantitative transition of histopathology. In this work we briefly survey major themes related to modernization of histopathology, review applications of CRI to histopathology and, finally, discuss potential roles for CRI in the transformation of histopathology that is already underway.},

We show that via an appropriate operator splitting scheme, Kerr nonlinearity and the self-steepening and stimulated Raman scattering terms can be combined into a single sub-step consisting of an inhomogeneous quasilinear first-order hyperbolic system for the real-valued quantities intensity and phase. First- and second-order accurate shock-capturing upwind schemes have been developed specifically for this nonlinear sub-step, which enables the accurate and oscillation-free simulation of signals under the influence of Raman scattering and extreme self-steepening with the SSFM. Benchmark computations of ultra-fast Gaussian pulses in fibers with strong nonlinearity demonstrate the superior approximation properties of the proposed approach.},

The SGLE gives a better description of the cavity dynamics by accounting explicitly for the full periodic transmission generated by the waveplates and polarizer. Numerical comparisons with the full dynamics show that the SGLE is able to capture the essential mode-locking behaviors including the multi-pulsing instability observed in the laser cavity and does not have the drawbacks of the conventional master mode-locking theory, and the results are applicable to both anomalous and normal dispersions. The SGLE model supports high energy pulses that are not predicted by the master mode-locking theory, thus providing a platform for optimizing the laser performance.},

  abstract = {Introduction: This project has investigated student and staff perceptions and experience of plagiarism in a large Australian dental school to develop a response to an external audit report. Methods: Workshops designed to enhance participants' understanding of plagiarism and to assist with practical ways to promote academic integrity within the school were provided to all students and staff. Anonymous surveys were used to investigate perceptions and experience of plagiarism and to assess the usefulness of the workshops. Results: Most participants felt that plagiarism was not a problem in the school, but a significant number were undecided. The majority of participants reported that the guidelines for dealing with plagiarism were inadequate and most supported the mandatory use of text-matching software in all courses. High proportions of participants indicated that the workshops were useful and that they would consider improving their practice as a result. Conclusions: The study provided data that enhanced understanding of aspects of plagiarism highlighted in the report at the school level and identified areas in need of attention, such as refining and raising awareness of the guidelines and incorporation of text-matching software into courses, as well as cautions to be considered ( how text-matching software is used) in planning responsive action.},

It combines molecular spectroscopy with high-resolution spatial information to create quantitative images of molecular distributions. Here I summarize recent progress in technical developments and biological applications of a specific chemical imaging technique-stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy. SRS microscopy allows for a wide range of molecules - both endogenous and exogenous - to be imaged at high spatial and temporal resolution in living cells, tissues, and organisms. I will focus on developments in SRS imaging that enable detection of non-fluorescent molecules and drive new biological applications.},

  abstract = {Nanomaterials (NMs) are used in an extremely diverse range of products and are increasingly entering the environment, driving a need to better understand their potential health effects in both humans and wildlife. A major challenge in nanoparticle (eco)toxicology is the ability to localise NMs post exposure, to enable more targeted biological effects analyses. A range of imaging techniques have been applied to do so, but they are limited, requiring either extensive processing of the material, staining or use of high intensity illumination that can lead to photo damage and/or have limited tissue penetration. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy is a label-free imaging technique, providing contrast based on the intrinsic molecular vibrations of a specimen, circumventing the need for chemical perturbation by exogenous labels. CARS uses near infra-red excitation wavelengths which allow microscopy at depths of several hundred microns in intact tissues and minimises photo-damage to live and delicate samples. Here we provide an overview of the CARS process and present a series of illustrative examples demonstrating its application for detecting NMs within biological tissues, ranging from isolated cells to whole organisms and including materials spanning metals to polymers. We highlight the advantages of this technique which include chemically selective live imaging and substantial depth penetration, but we also discuss its limitations when applied to nanotoxicology, which most notably include the lack of resolution for studies on single nanoparticles.},

However, current imaging modalities either require tedious sample preparation or only apply to nanoparticles with specific physicochemical characteristics. Here, the emerging hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, as a label-free and nondestructive imaging method, is used for the first time to investigate the subcellular distribution of nanoparticles in the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila. The two frequently studied nanoparticles, polyacrylate-coated alpha-Fe2 O3 and TiO2 , are found to have different subcellular distribution pattern as a result of their dissimilar uptake routes. Significant uptake competition between these two types of nanoparticles is further discovered, which should be paid attention to in future bioapplications of nanoparticles. Overall, this study illustrates the great promise of hyperspectral SRS as an analytical imaging tool in nanobiotechnology and nanotoxicology.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate two complementary types of microscopy using an identical setup for single-pulse coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) imaging, which employs an ultrabroadband laser pulse with a spectral bandwidth of 4800 cm(-1) and enables the suppression of nonresonant CARS signals. One is a novel type of microscopy that uses spectral phase modulation for the selective excitation of a single Raman mode. The selective excitation is achieved by the modulated pulse focusing its difference-frequency spectrum into a narrow spectral region. Another type is Fourier-transform CARS (FT-CARS) microspectroscopy based on the measurement of the CARS spectrum obtained from the Fourier-transform of the interferometric autocorrelation (IAC) signal. Vibrational spectral imaging of chemical and biological samples is demonstrated using the two types of microscopy. (C) 2009 Optical Society of America},

The presence of the wells leads to a high degree of lateral transport within the channel and rapid mixing of two confluent streams undergoing electroosmotic flow. Several mixer designs were fabricated and investigated. All designs were relatively successful at low flow rates (0.06 cm/s, greater than or equal to 75% mixing), but had varying degrees of success at high flow rates (0.81 cm/s, 45-80% mixing). For example, one design operating at high flow rates was able to split an incoming fluorescent stream into two streams of varying concentrations depending on the number of slanted wells present. The final mixer design was able to overcome stream splitting at high flow rates, and it was shown that the two incoming streams were 80% mixed, within 443 mum of the T-junction for a flow rate of 0.81 cm/s. Without the presence of the mixer and at the same high flow rate, a channel length of 2.3 cm would be required to achieve the same extent of mixing when relying upon molecular diffusion entirely, while 6.9 cm would be required for 99% mixing.},

The system utilizes a configuration of laser sources that probes the entire biologically relevant Raman window (500–3,500 cm–1) with high resolution (<10 cm–1). It strongly and efficiently stimulates Raman transitions within the typically weak ‘fingerprint’ region using intrapulse three-colour excitation, and utilizes the non-resonant background to heterodyne-amplify weak Raman signals. We demonstrate high-speed chemical imaging in two- and three-dimensional views of healthy murine liver and pancreas tissues as well as interfaces between xenograft brain tumours and the surrounding healthy brain matter.

  abstract = {Raman scattering, an inelastic scattering mechanism, provides information about molecular excitation energies and can be used to identify chemical compounds. Albeit being a powerful analysis tool, especially for label-free biomedical imaging with molecular contrast, it suffers from inherently low signal levels. This practical limitation can be overcome by nonlinear enhancement techniques like stimulated Raman scattering (SRS). In SRS, an additional light source stimulates the Raman scattering process. This can lead to orders of magnitude increase in signal levels and hence faster acquisition in biomedical imaging. However, achieving a broad spectral coverage in SRS is technically challenging and the signal is no longer background-free, as either stimulated Raman gain (SRG) or loss (SRL) is measured, turning a sensitivity limit into a dynamic range limit. Thus, the signal has to be isolated from the laser background light, requiring elaborate methods for minimizing detection noise. Here, we analyze the detection sensitivity of a shot-noise limited broadband stimulated time-encoded Raman (TICO-Raman) system in detail. In time-encoded Raman, a wavelength-swept Fourier domain mode locking (FDML) laser covers a broad range of Raman transition energies while allowing a dual-balanced detection for lowering the detection noise to the fundamental shot-noise limit.},

Numerical simulations of pulse propagation around such a fiber loop are presented which reveal that this mode-locking scheme does not result in strictly uniform pulse trains. Rather, the train of output pulses exhibits periodic fluctuations in intensity and polarization. A model for the pulse dynamics is developed which shows that these fluctuations depend on the strength of the fiber birefringence and the alignment of the polarizer with the fast- and slow-polarization axes of the fiber. It is also shown that increased uniformity of pulse trains is achieved with near alignment of the polarizer with the slow axis of the birefringence.},

  abstract = {An overview of the progress on pulse-preserving, coherent, nonlinear fiber-based supercontinuum generation is presented. The context encompasses various wavelength ranges and pump sources, starting with silica photonic crystal fibers pumped with 1.0 ae m femtosecond lasers up to chalcogenide step-index and microstructured fibers pumped from optical parametric amplifiers tuned to mid-infrared wavelengths. In particular, silica and silicatebased all-normal dispersion (ANDi) photonic crystal fibers have been demonstrated for pumping with femtosecond lasers operating at 1.56 mu m with the recorded spectra covering 0.9 -2.3 mu m. This matches amplification bands of robust fiber amplifiers and femtosecond lasers. The review therefore focuses specifically on this wavelength range, discussing glass and nonlinear fiber designs, experimental results on supercontinuum generation up to the fundamental limit of oxide glass fiber transmission around 2.8 mu m, and various limitations of supercontinuum bandwidth and coherence. Specifically, the role of nonlinear response against the role of dispersion profile shape is analyzed for two different soft glass ANDi fibers pumped at more than 2.0 mu m. A spatio-temporal interaction of the fundamental fiber mode with modes propagating in the photonic lattice of the discussed ANDi fibers is shown to have positive effects on the coherence of the supercontinuum at pump pulse durations of 400 fs. Finally, the design and development of graded-index, nanostructured core optical fibers are discussed. In such structures the arbitrary shaping of the core refractive index profile could significantly improve the engineering flexibility of dispersion and effective mode area characteristics, and would be an interesting platform to further study the intermodal interaction mechanisms and their impact on supercontinuum coherence for subpicosecond laser pumped setups.

  abstract = {Supercontinuum spanning over an octave from 900 - 2300 nm is reported in an all-normal dispersion, soft glass photonic crystal fiber. The all-solid microstructured fiber was engineered to achieve a normal dispersion profile flattened to within - 50 to - 30 ps/nm/km in the wavelength range of 1100 - 2700 nm. Under pumping with 75 fs pulses centered at 1550 nm, the recorded spectral flatness is 7 dB in the 930 - 2170 nm range, and significantly less if cladding modes present in the uncoated photonic crystal fiber are removed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an octave-spanning, all-normal dispersion supercontinuum generation in a non-silica microstructured fiber, where the spectrum long-wavelength edge is red-shifted to as far as 2300 nm. This is also an important step in moving the concept of ultrafast coherent supercontinuum generation in all-normal dispersion fibers further towards the mid-infrared spectral region.

  abstract = {When coupled to characteristic, fingerprint vibrational and rotational motions of molecules, an electromagnetic field with an appropriate frequency and waveform offers a highly sensitive, highly informative probe, enabling chemically specific studies on a broad class of systems in physics, chemistry, biology, geosciences, and medicine. The frequencies of these signature molecular modes, however, lie in a region where accurate spectroscopic measurements are extremely difficult because of the lack of efficient detectors and spectrometers. Here, we show that, with a combination of advanced ultrafast technologies and nonlinear-optical waveform characterization, time-domain techniques can be advantageously extended to the metrology of fundamental molecular motions in the mid-infrared. In our scheme, the spectral modulation of ultrashort mid-infrared pulses, induced by rovibrational motions of molecules, gives rise to interfering coherent dark waveforms in the time domain. These high-visibility interference patterns can be read out by cross-correlation frequency-resolved gating of the field in the visible generated through ultrabroadband four-wave mixing in a gas phase.},

Such difficulties can be circumvented by a label-free imaging technique known as coherent anti-Stokes Raman (CARS) microscopy, which is capable of chemically selective, highly sensitive, and high-speed imaging of lipid-rich structures with submicron three-dimensional spatial resolution. We review the broad applications of CARS microscopy to studies of lipid biology in cell cultures, tissue biopsies, and model organisms.

  abstract = {The aim of microfluidic mixing is to achieve a thorough and rapid mixing of multiple samples in microscale devices. In such devices, sample mixing is essentially achieved by enhancing the diffusion effect between the different species flows. Broadly speaking, microfluidic mixing schemes can be categorized as either "active", where an external energy force is applied to perturb the sample species, or "passive", where the contact area and contact time of the species samples are increased through specially-designed microchannel configurations. Many mixers have been proposed to facilitate this task over the past 10 years. Accordingly, this paper commences by providing a high level overview of the field of microfluidic mixing devices before describing some of the more significant proposals for active and passive mixers.},

C-GNLSE in the normal picture is first mapped into the interaction picture by the representation transformation, and then, the two coupled nonlinear partial differential equations in the interaction picture are solved in frequency domain, with synchronous data updating in each iteration step, by using the vector form of Hult's fourth-order Runge-Kutta iterative scheme. The proposed vector form algorithm of fourth-order Runge-Kutta in interaction picture (V-JH-RK4IP) is verified by using it in simulating the supercontinuum generation in high birefringence photonic crystal fiber. Moreover, the V-JH-RK4IP algorithm also exhibits the highest accuracy and computational efficiency as compared to other classical algorithms.},

  abstract = {Real-time vibrational spectroscopic imaging is desired for monitoring cellular states and cellular processes in a label-free manner. Raman spectroscopic imaging of highly dynamic systems is inhibited by relatively slow spectral acquisition on millisecond to second scale. Here, we report microsecond scale vibrational spectroscopic imaging by lock-in free parallel detection of spectrally dispersed stimulated Raman scattering signal. Using a homebuilt tuned amplifier array, our method enables Raman spectral acquisition, within the window defined by the broadband pulse, at the speed of 32 mu s and with close to shot-noise limited detection sensitivity. Incorporated with multivariate curve resolution analysis, our platform allows compositional mapping of lipid droplets in single live cells, observation of intracellular retinoid metabolism, discrimination of fat droplets from protein-rich organelles in Caenorhabditis elegans, spectral detection of fast flowing tumor cells and monitoring drug diffusion through skin tissue in vivo. The reported technique opens new opportunities for compositional analysis of cellular compartment in a microscope setting and high-throughput spectral profiling of single cells in a flow cytometer setting.},

  abstract = {Studied in this paper are the bright–dark vector soliton solutions for a generalized coupled Hirota system which describes the propagation for the high-intensity ultrashort pulses in the optical glass fiber. Beyond the existing bilinear forms, using an auxiliary function, we obtain the improved bilinear forms and bright–dark soliton solutions under two integrable constraints through the Hirota method and symbolic computation. With the help the analytic and graphic analysis, we study the soliton properties including the amplitudes, velocities and phase shifts, and show that the interactions for the bright–dark two solitons are elastic. For the bright–dark one soliton, parametric conditions that the dark component is “black” or “gray” are obtained. For the bright–dark two solitons, we find that the bright component is affected by the dark component background parameters during such an interaction, while the dark component is not affected by the bright component background parameters. Velocities for the bright–dark two solitons are inversely proportional to the higher-order effect parameter, but amplitudes and phase shifts are independent of it. Besides, the bound-state bright–dark two solitons are also presented.},

The influence of the products of phospholipolysis of lecithin on palmitic acid solubility was determined. On a molar basis, lysolecithin was more effective than were bile salts in promoting the solubilization of the fatty acid. 3. In bile salt solutions in which the phospholipid concentration was constant on a molar basis, in solubility of palmitic acid decreased linearly with the progressive replacement of lecithin by lysolecithin. Palmitic acid was solubilized to the same extent on replacing lecithin with lysolecithin on a constant weight basis. 4. In bile salt solution containing lysolecithin and oleic acid in equimolar amounts, the solubility of palmitic acid was similar to that in bile salt solution containing lecithin in equivalent proportion. 5. The results are discussed in relation to the action of phospholipolytic activity on the intestinal absorption of fatty acids in sheep.},

Coherent nonlinear optical imaging, especially the recently developed nonlinear dissipation microscopy (including stimulated Raman scattering and two-photon absorption) and pump-probe microscopy (including excited-state absorption, stimulated emission, and ground-state depletion), provides new image contrasts for nonfluorescent species. Thanks to the high-frequency modulation transfer scheme, these imaging techniques exhibit superb detection sensitivity. By directly interrogating vibrational and/or electronic energy levels of molecules, they offer high molecular specificity. Here we review the underlying principles and excitation and detection schemes, as well as exemplary biomedical applications of this emerging class of molecular imaging techniques.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional resonance Raman (2DRR) spectroscopy has recently been developed as a tool for studies of structural heterogeneity and photochemical dynamics in condensed phases. In this paper, 2DRR spectroscopy is used to investigate line broadening mechanisms of both oxygen- and water-ligated myoglobins. General signatures of anharmonicity and inhomogeneous line broadening are first established with model calculations to facilitate signal interpretation. It is shown that the present quasi-degenerate version of 2DRR spectroscopy is insensitive to anharmonicity, because signal generation is allowed for harmonic modes. Rather, the key information to be gained from 2DRR spectroscopy pertains to the line broadening mechanisms, which are fairly obvious by inspection of the data. 2DRR signals acquired for both heme protein systems reveal significant heterogeneity in the vibrational modes local to the heme’s propionic acid side chains. These side chains are known to interact with solvent, because they protrude from the hydrophobic pocket that encloses the heme. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the heterogeneity detected in our 2DRR experiments reflects fluctuations in the geometries of the side chains. Knowledge of such thermal motions will be useful for understanding protein function (e.g., ligand binding) because the side chains are an effective “gateway” for the exchange of thermal energy between the heme and solvent.},

  abstract = {Femtosecond Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy (FSRS) is motivated by the knowledge of the molecular geometry changes that accompany sub-picosecond chemical reactions. The detection of vibrational resonances throughout the entire fingerprint region of the spectrum with sub-100-fs delay precision is fairly straightforward to accomplish with the FSRS technique. Despite its utility, FSRS must contend with substantial technical challenges that stem from a large background of residual laser light and lower-order nonlinearities when all laser pulses are electronically resonant with the equilibrium system. In this work, a geometry based on five incident laser beams is used to eliminate much of this undesired background in experiments conducted on metmyoglobin. Compared to a three-beam FSRS geometry with all electronically resonant laser pulses, the five-beam approach described here offers major improvements in the data acquisition rate, sensitivity, and background suppression. The susceptibility of the five-beam geometry to experimental artifacts is investigated using control experiments and model calculations. Of particular concern are undesired cascades of third-order nonlinearities, which are known to challenge FSRS measurements carried out on electronically off-resonant systems. It is generally understood that “forbidden” steps in the desired nonlinear optical processes are the origin of the problems encountered under off-resonant conditions. In contrast, the present experiments are carried out under electronically resonant conditions, where such unfortunate selection rules do not apply. Nonetheless, control experiments based on spectroscopic line shapes, signal phases, and sample concentrations are conducted to rule out significant contributions from cascades of third-order processes. Theoretical calculations are further used to estimate the relative intensities of the direct and cascaded responses. Overall, the control experiments and model calculations presented in this work suggest promise for multidimensional resonance Raman investigations of heme proteins.},

The optical fiber consists of a fiber Bragg grating component to serve as a narrowband notch filter and a combined large-mode-area fiber to transmit such shaped ultrashort laser pulses without spectral distortion in a long distance. Experimentally, our implementation showed a capability to measure CARS spectra of various samples with molecular vibrations in the fingerprint region. Furthermore, CARS imaging of poly(methyl methacrylate) bead samples was carried out successfully under epi-CARS geometry in which backward-scattered CARS signals were collected into a multimode optical fiber. A compatibility of single-pulse CARS scheme with fiber optics, verified in this study, implies a potential for future realization of compact all-fiber CARS spectroscopic imaging systems.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Defective autophagy in macrophages leads to pathological processes that contribute to atherosclerosis, including impaired cholesterol metabolism and defective efferocytosis. Autophagy promotes the degradation of cytoplasmic components in lysosomes and plays a key role in the catabolism of stored lipids to maintain cellular homeostasis. microRNA-33 (miR-33) is a post-transcriptional regulator of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis, yet the complete mechanisms by which miR-33 controls lipid metabolism are unknown. We investigated whether miR-33 targeting of autophagy contributes to its regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and atherogenesis. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Using coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy, we show that miR-33 drives lipid droplet accumulation in macrophages, suggesting decreased lipolysis. Inhibition of neutral and lysosomal hydrolysis pathways revealed that miR-33 reduced cholesterol mobilization by a lysosomal-dependent mechanism, implicating repression of autophagy. Indeed, we show that miR-33 targets key autophagy regulators and effectors in macrophages to reduce lipid droplet catabolism, an essential process to generate free cholesterol for efflux. Notably, miR-33 regulation of autophagy lies upstream of its known effects on ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1)-dependent cholesterol efflux, as miR-33 inhibitors fail to increase efflux upon genetic or chemical inhibition of autophagy. Furthermore, we find that miR-33 inhibits apoptotic cell clearance via an autophagy-dependent mechanism. Macrophages treated with anti-miR-33 show increased efferocytosis, lysosomal biogenesis, and degradation of apoptotic material. Finally, we show that treating atherosclerotic Ldlr(-/-) mice with anti-miR-33 restores defective autophagy in macrophage foam cells and plaques and promotes apoptotic cell clearance to reduce plaque necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data provide insight into the mechanisms by which miR-33 regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis and atherosclerosis.},

  abstract = {To date, medical imaging of tissues has largely relied on time-consuming staining processes, and there is a need for rapid, label-free imaging techniques. Stimulated Raman scattering microscopy offers a three-dimensional, real-time imaging capability with chemical specificity. However, it can be difficult to differentiate between several constituents in tissues because their spectral characteristics can overlap. Furthermore, imaging speeds in previous multispectral stimulated Raman scattering imaging techniques were limited. Here, we demonstrate label-free imaging of tissues by 30 frames/s stimulated Raman scattering microscopy with frame-by-frame wavelength tunability. To produce multicolour images showing different constituents, spectral images were processed by modified independent component analysis, which can extract small differences in spectral features. We present various imaging modalities such as two-dimensional spectral imaging of rat liver, two-colour three-dimensional imaging of a vessel in rat liver, spectral imaging of several sections of intestinal villi in mouse, and in vivo spectral imaging of mouse ear skin.},

This is a large virus with a long, contractile tail terminating in a base plate with spikes. In the present work, isolated virions were exposed to a variety of dissociative reagents and conditions. They were then tested for residual infectivity and depolymerase activity, as well as inspected under an electron microscope. Very mild acid treatment (10 to 15 min at pH 4.0 and 37 C) was found to cause a specific detachment of some phage spikes, together with a moderate drop in both infectivity and depolymerase activity. Large batches of viruses were fragmented in this manner, and the detached spikes were isolated. The host capsule depolymerase activity was found to be associated with these organelles. In negatively stained preparations, the spikes exhibited a length of approximately 18 nm and a thickness of about 5 nm. By sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, they were found to contain polypeptides with molecular weights of 80,000 and 145, 000.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate near shot-noise limited hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) spectroscopy using oscillator-only excitation conditions. Using a fast CMOS camera synchronized to an acousto-optic modulator and subtracting subsequent frames acquired at up to 1 MHz frame rates, we demonstrate demodulation and recovery of the SRS spectrum. Surprisingly, we observe that the signal-to-noise of SRS spectra is invariant at modulation frequencies down to 2.5 kHz. Our approach allows for a direct comparison of SRS with coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy under identical experimental conditions. Our findings suggest that hyperspectral SRS imaging with shot-noise limited performance at biologically compatible excitation energies is feasible after minor modifications to fast frame-rate CMOS array technology.

Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy allows highly sensitive optical imaging based on vibrational spectroscopy without adding toxic or perturbative labels. However, SRS imaging in living animals and humans has not been feasible because light cannot be collected through thick tissues, and motion-blur arises from slow imaging based on backscattered light. In this work, we enable in vivo SRS imaging by substantially enhancing the collection of the backscattered signal and increasing the imaging speed by three orders of magnitude to video rate. This approach allows label-free in vivo imaging of water, lipid, and protein in skin and mapping of penetration pathways of topically applied drugs in mice and humans.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear Laser Scanning Microscopy (NLSM) techniques have been demonstrated in the past two decades as powerful imaging tools for disease diagnostics (DD). Currently, in most DD related experiments the interpretation of NLSM data sets is performed by trained specialists. Such approaches are both time consuming and prone to errors due to inter- and intra-observer discrepancies. The Bag-of-Features (BoF) paradigm has demonstrated its potential usefulness with respect to automated data classification in the frame of multiple experiments, but its intersections with the field of NLSM are at this moment scarce, to say the least. In this paper we review recent progress on DD using NLSM, and discuss necessary steps and potential future perspectives for merging NLSM and BoF to achieve complex frameworks for automated DD with high sensitivity and specificity.},

In this Letter, we present an application of adaptive optics to enhance the Raman scattering signal detected through a turbid, optically thick material. This technique utilizes recent advances in wavefront shaping techniques for focusing light through a turbid media and applies them to chemical detection to achieve a signal enhancement with little sacrifice to the overall simplicity of the experimental setup. With this technique, we demonstrate an enhancement in the Raman signal from titanium dioxide particles through a highly scattering material. This technique may pave the way to label-free tracking using the optical memory effect.},

METHODS: High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) was used to achieve a quantitative biochemical determination of the sterols. The intercellular lipids were visualized by Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, which enables label-free imaging of the lipids in intact tissue samples. RESULTS: The results show that the total lipid content of the cholesteatoma matrix is similar to that of stratum corneum from skin and that the cholesteatoma matrix unquestionably contains cholesterol. The cholesterol content in the cholesteatoma matrix is increased by over 30% (w/w dry weight) compared to the control. The cholesterol sulfate content is below 1% of the total lipids in both the cholesteatoma and the control. Cholesterol ester was reduced by over 30% when compared to the control. CONCLUSIONS: The content of cholesterol in the cholesteatoma matrix is significantly different from that in stratum corneum from skin, and we confirm that the main structure of the cholesteatoma resembles very thick stratum corneum.},

  abstract = {Optical imaging plays a major role in both basic biological research and clinical diagnostics, providing noninvasive or minimally invasive microscopic imaging capability to investigate biological tissues. Optical image acquisition through significant depths of biological tissues, however, presents a major challenge since tissue is extremely heterogeneous and the strong scattering of the various tissue components has restricted high-resolution optical imaging to superficial layers. Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) has significantly extended the penetration depth of high-resolution optical imaging, particularly for in vivo applications. Multiphoton imaging critically depends on ultrafast technologies, particularly pulsed excitation sources. In this paper, the basics of deep tissue MPM and its improvements utilizing soliton self-frequency shift (SSFS) are reviewed. Wavelength tunable, high-energy soliton generation through SSFS in large-mode-area (LMA) fibers and photonic crystal rods is presented. The application of these solitons to MPM enables noninvasive imaging in biological tissues with unprecedented depth. The main characteristics of the excitation source for deep tissue MPM, such as wavelength, pulse energy, and repetition rate, are discussed.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate a hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope through spectral-transformed excitation. The 1064 nm Stokes pulse was from a synchronized time-lens source, generated through time-domain phase modulation of a continuous wave (CW) laser. The tunable pump pulse was from linear spectral filtering of a femtosecond laser output with an intra-pulse spectral scanning pulse shaper. By electronically modulating the time-lens source at 2.29 MHz, hyperspectral stimulated Raman loss (SRL) images were obtained on a laser-scanning microscope. Using this microscope, DMSO in aqueous solution with a concentration down to 28 mM could be detected at 2 μs time constant. Hyperspectral SRL images of prostate cancer cells were obtained. Multivariate curve resolution analysis was further applied to decompose the SRL images into concentration maps of CH2 and CH3bonds. This method offers exciting potential in label-free imaging of live cells using fingerprint Raman bands. (© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

The proposed method reveals both the amplitude and the phase of molecular vibrations by utilizing the cross-correlation frequency resolved optical gating (XFROG) technique. The spectrum of the anti-Stokes pulse is measured as a function of the time delay between the laser-induced molecular vibrations and a well characterized broadband femtosecond probe pulse. The iterative XFROG algorithm provides a simultaneous complete characterization of molecular vibrations both in frequency and time domains with high resolution. They demonstrate experimentally the feasibility of the proposed method and show one of its potential applications in disentangling the time behavior of a mixture of vibrationally excited molecules. The technique of femtosecond pulse shaping is used for further improvement of accuracy and stability against noise.},

Such nonlinear optical measurements are commonly performed on large ensembles of molecules and, as such, are limited to the extent that ensemble coherence can be maintained. Here, we describe vibrational wave packet motion on single molecules, recorded through time-resolved, surface-enhanced, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering. The sensitivity required to detect the motion of a single molecule under ambient conditions is achieved by equipping the molecule with a dipolar nano-antenna (a gold dumbbell). In contrast with measurements in ensembles, the vibrational coherence on a single molecule does not undergo pure dephasing. It develops phase fluctuations with characteristic statistics. We present the time evolution of discretely sampled statistical states, and highlight the unique information content in the characteristic, early-time probability distribution function of the signal.},

The stable working range extends from 10 to 280kHz; at the highest repetition rate of 280kHz, the maximum average output power of 11.2W and the shortest pulse width of 18.4ns are achieved at an absorbed pump power of 19.3W, corresponding to an optical-optical conversion efficiency of 58% and a slope efficiency of 62.2%. A near-diffraction-limit beam is obtained with beam quality factor of M 2ap1.2 at the maximum absorbed pump power. Because of the weak thermal effect, the M 2 factor almost remains constant at different pulse repetition rates. [All rights reserved Elsevier].},

  abstract = {A fourth-order Runge-Kutta in the interaction picture (RK4IP) method is presented for solving the coupled nonlinear Schr odinger equation (CNLSE) that governs the light propagation in optical fibers with randomly varying birefringence. The computational error of RK4IP is caused by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm, better than the split-step approximation limited by the step size. As a result, the step size of RK4IP can have the same order of magnitude as the dispersion length and/or the nonlinear length of the fiber, provided the birefringence effect is small. For communication fibers with random birefringence, the step size of RK4IP can be orders of magnitude larger than the correlation length and the beating length of the fibers, depending on the interaction between linear and nonlinear effects. Our approach can be applied to the fibers having the general form of local birefringence and treat the Kerr nonlinearity without approximation. Our RK4IP results agree well with those obtained from Manakov-PMD approximation, provided the polarization state can be mixed enough on the Poincar e sphere.},

  abstract   = {精密干涉测量主要以激光波长作为“尺子”,利用干涉原理来测定各种参量,如加速度,位移、角位移等等。由于光波长为微米数量级,因此其分辨精度是电学、磁学元件无法比拟的。但是,受激光器自身和周围环境因素影响,激光频率存在不同程度的漂移,频率的漂移必然会导致波长的漂移,这将直接降低干涉测量的精度,因此必须对激光器进行稳频。 本文介绍了He-Ne激光器塞曼效应的成因和塞曼效应稳频的基本原理,描述了塞曼效应稳频微晶玻璃He-Ne激光器的基本结构与其突出的优良特性,基于C8051F121单片机完成了激光器稳频控制系统的设计与制作,基于拍频法的原理搭建测试系统进行了激光器稳频性能指标的测试工作,并结合实验...},
